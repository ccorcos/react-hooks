# React Hooks Exploration

## Examples

1. `BasicCounter` demonstrating the basics of hooks. Using `hooks.ts` to patch the lack of Typescript type definitions.

2. `CountersWithStores` demonstrating how you can use a state container pattern to effectively lift state to a parent without having to manually handle optional props everywhere. Note, this approach dynamically created hooks so you have to be careful how you use it.

3. `ElmishCounter` demonstrates how you can use hooks to emulate the Elm architecture (very similar to Redux), and `ElmishListOf` demonstrating the functional abstraction power with a higher order component.
